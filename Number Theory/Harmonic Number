Harmonic Number

Given a number N. The task is to find the Nth Harmonic Number.

Let the nth harmonic number be Hn.

The harmonic series is as follows:


H1 = 1
H2 = H1 + 1/2
H3 = H2 + 1/3
H4 = H3 + 1/4
.
.
.
Hn = Hn-1 + 1/n

Examples:




Input : N = 5
Output : 2.45

Input : N = 9
Output : 2.71786
