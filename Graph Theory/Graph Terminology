A graph consists of nodes and edges.
n = nodes
m = egdes
path : path leads node "a" to node "b" through using one or 
       multiple egdes .
       The length of path = number of edges one node to another .
                          = sum of weigt of each edges involve in path ( weighted graph)
                          
Cycle : if first and last node is same .

Simple Path : if each node appears at most once in the path .
              so ,we can tell cycle can't be a cycle cause at cycle first and last node is same.
            
Connected Graph : if any there is a path between any two nodes. That means there is no single isolated node.
                   if there is single isolated nodes available on graph that is not a connected graph.
                   
The connected components of a graph are called its components.

Tree : A connected graph consists of n nodes and (n-1) edges .

Directed Graph : A graph is directed if the edges can be traversed in one direction only.
weighted Graph : A graph is weighted if every edges assigned a weight which can be it distance or anyting else.
