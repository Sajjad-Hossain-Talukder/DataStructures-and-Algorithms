Greedy Algorithm can help us to solve most of problems but in some case it Fails . 0 - 1 Knapsack is one of them , in which case 
it fails . Apparently it will assume that we can solve it using greedy approach , But there is some trivial case which can not be solved using greedy .
In this case , solving approach will be Dynamic programming . Let's have a look on following example down below : 


price  : 1  4  5  7 
weight : 1  3  4  7
