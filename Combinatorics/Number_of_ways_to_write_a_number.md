### Number of ways to write a number

```

1 + 1 + 5 = 7
1 + 5 + 1 = 7
5 + 1 + 1 = 7
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
1 + 4 + 2 = 7
4 + 1 + 2 = 7
2 + 1 + 4 = 7
2 + 4 + 1 = 7
4 + 2 + 1 = 7
1 + 3 + 3 = 7
3 + 1 + 3 = 7
3 + 3 + 1 = 7
2 + 2 + 3 = 7
2 + 3 + 2 = 7
3 + 2 + 2 = 7
      
```

Do you want to output the counts of different ways to write a number? If so, then given a number n which has to be divided into k parts, 
the count is exactly given by  <b> <sup>(n-1)</sup> C <sub>(k-1)</sub> </b>


If you plug in, n = 7, k =3, you would get 15, which is what we found above.
