  <summary>Description  : </summary>
  <p>The <b>Hungarian graph algorithm solves the linear assignment problem in polynomial time</b>. By modeling resources (e.g., contractors and available contracts) as a graph, the Hungarian algorithm can be used to efficiently determine an optimum way of allocating resources.
  </p>
  
  <p>The Hungarian Algorithm is <b>used to find the minimum cost in assignment problems that involve assigning people to activities. </b>
    </p>
  <p>
    The Hungarian method is a <b>combinatorial optimization algorithm</b> that solves the assignment 
    problem in<b> polynomial time </b> and which <b> anticipated later primal–dual methods</b>.

  <summary>History :  </summary>
  <p>
    It was developed and published in 1955 by Harold Kuhn, who gave the name "Hungarian method" because the algorithm was largely based on the 
    earlier works of two Hungarian mathematicians: Dénes Kőnig and Jenő Egerváry. </p>
  <p>  James Munkres reviewed the algorithm in 1957 and observed that
    it is (strongly) polynomial.[3] Since then the algorithm has been known also as <b>the Kuhn–Munkres algorithm or Munkres assignment algorithm</b>. 
    The time complexity of the original algorithm was O(N<sup>4</sup>), however Edmonds and Karp, and independently Tomizawa noticed that it can be
    modified to achieve an O(N<sup>3</sup>) running time. One of the most popular[citation needed] O(N<sup>3</sup>) variants is 
    the Jonker–Volgenant algorithm. </p>
  <p>
    <b>Ford and Fulkerson extended the method to general maximum flow problems in form of the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm</b>. In 2006, it was 
    discovered that Carl Gustav Jacobi had solved the assignment problem in the 19th century, and the solution had been published posthumously in 1890 in Latin.
