## Index Mapping (or Trivial Hashing) with negatives allowed

> Given a limited range array contains both positive and non-positive numbers, i.e., elements are in the range from -MAX to +MAX. Our task is to search if some number is present in the array or not in O(1) time.

> Since range is limited, we can use index mapping (or trivial hashing). We use values as the index in a big array. Therefore we can search and insert elements in O(1) time.

How to handle negative numbers?
The idea is to use a 2D array of size hash[MAX+1][2]

#### Algorithm:

> Assign all the values of the hash matrix as 0.
        Traverse the given array:
            If the element ele is non negative assign 
        hash[ele][0] as 1.
    Else take the absolute value of ele and 
         assign hash[ele][1] as 1.
         
##### To search any element x in the array:
- If X is non-negative check if hash[X][0] is 1 or not. If hash[X][0] is one then the number is present else not present.
- If X is negative take absolute value of X and then check if hash[X][1] is 1 or not. If hash[X][1] is one then the number is present
Below is the implementation of the above idea.

```
// CPP program to implement direct index mapping
// with negative values allowed.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define MAX 1000
  
// Since array is global, it is initialized as 0.
bool has[MAX + 1][2];
  
// searching if X is Present in the given array 
// or not.
bool search(int X)
{
    if (X >= 0) {
        if (has[X][0] == 1)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
  
    // if X is negative take the absolute 
    // value of X.
    X = abs(X);
    if (has[X][1] == 1)
        return true;
  
    return false;
}
  
void insert(int a[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] >= 0) 
            has[a[i]][0] = 1;
       else
            has[abs(a[i])][1] = 1;
    }
}
  
// Driver code
int main()
{
    int a[] = { -1, 9, -5, -8, -5, -2 };
    int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
    insert(a, n);
    int X = -5;
    if (search(X) == true)
       cout << "Present"; 
    else
       cout << "Not Present";
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
Present
