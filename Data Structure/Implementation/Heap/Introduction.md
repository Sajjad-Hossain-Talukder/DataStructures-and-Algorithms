### Heap Data Structure 

**A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.** Generally, Heaps can be of two types: 
> **Max-Heap** : In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

> **Min-Heap** : In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
