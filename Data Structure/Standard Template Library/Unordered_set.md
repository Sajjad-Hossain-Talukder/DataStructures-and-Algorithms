### Unordered_set


         NOTES:
           0. Unordered_Set is a associative container that contains set of unique objects.
           1. Search, insertion, and removal have average constant-time complexity.
           2. Internally, the elements are organized into buckets.
           3. It uses hashing to insert elements into buckets. 
           4. This allows fast access to individual elements, since once a hash is computed, 
                   it refers to the exact bucket the element is placed into.

#### WHY UNORDERED SET?
    To Maintain a collection of unique items with fast insertion and removal.
